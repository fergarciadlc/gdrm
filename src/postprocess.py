"""
This module converts a numpy array (one bar) back into a MIDI file.
It loads a numpy array that represents note events in a 10 (families) x 48 (grid locations) array.
For each non-empty cell, a note_on event is created using its family (mapped to a specific MIDI note)
and its onset time computed from a custom division grid.
The resulting MIDI messages are printed to the console before saving the MIDI file.

    Reads a numpy array from a file, then converts the note event data back into a MIDI file.
